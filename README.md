# React Native - Favorite Place
Demo application to learn React Native, using device features (location and camera) and SQLite to store data in the phone.

The app allows the user to create a list of favorite locations. Each location should have a title, a picture and a location.

To take a picture, the user should allow camera access. To get the location, the user can either choose it on the map or allow location access so the phone can get it automatically.

To get the address, this app uses reverse geolocation. Please set an API key in the `/util/location.js` file.
